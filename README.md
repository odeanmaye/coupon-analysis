# Summary of Findings

In this analysis, we explored the factors influencing whether a customer will accept a coupon delivered to their cell phone while driving. The key findings are summarized as follows:

## Analysis of Bar Coupons

### Observations

- **Frequent Bar Visitors**: Respondents who frequented bars were highly likely to accept the Bar coupon.
- **Age Influence**: Respondents under 21 that visited bars infrequently were 60% likely to accept the coupon. However, when combined with similarly inclined respondents aged 26, the acceptance rate increased significantly to 70%.
- **Income Impact**: Lower income/lower spending respondents were among the least likely to accept the coupon.

**Conclusion**: Drivers with more disposable income who visit bars frequently were most likely to accept the Bar coupon.

## Analysis of Coffee House Coupons

### Findings and Recommendations

- **Random Distribution**: Distributing Coffee House coupons randomly resulted in a 50% acceptance rate.
- **Timed Distribution**: Timing the coupons to be distributed at 10AM increases the probability of acceptance to 63%.
- **Age Influence**: Respondents below 21 responded favorably 68% of the time but they represent only 3.75% of respondents.
- **Frequent Coffee House Visitors**: A high percentage of respondents who frequented coffee houses responded favorably to the offer.
- **Combined Factors**: 88% of respondents below the age of 21 who frequented coffeehouses and received the coupon at 10AM responded favorably. Despite being statistically significant, the small number of respondents in this category makes it less ideal for business purposes.

**Conclusion**: To make a Coffee House coupon campaign more successful, focus on sending coupons at 10AM to drivers who frequent coffee shops. This strategy would result in a high response rate from a population significant for business purposes.
